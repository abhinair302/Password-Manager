# 🔐 Password Manager - Python Tkinter App

This is a simple **Password Manager GUI application** built using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to generate secure passwords and store them locally in a JSON file along with the associated website and email/username. I made this project as a part of a Udemy course. So special Thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for guiding me step by step, to build this project.
